# Fake Job Detector 

Fake Job Detector is a machine learning–based application designed to identify fraudulent job postings using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

# Project Overview
With the increasing number of fake job listings online, this project aims to help users distinguish between **real** and **fraudulent** job postings by analyzing textual data and patterns.

# Features
- Classifies job postings as **Real** or **Fake**
- Uses NLP for text preprocessing
- Implements supervised machine learning models
- Helps reduce scam and fraud risks

# Tech Stack
- Python
- Machine Learning
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- TF-IDF / Count Vectorizer

# How It Works
1. Job description text is preprocessed (cleaning, tokenization, vectorization)
2. Features are extracted using NLP techniques
3. Machine learning models classify the job posting
4. Output predicts whether the job is **genuine** or **fraudulent**

# Project Purpose
This project was built to understand text preprocessing, NLP techniques, and supervised machine learning for real-world fraud detection problems.
